My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about).

*Note:* unless otherwise specified, these solutions assume that inputs are well-formed and contain a valid solution. As such, nice-to-haves like error handling remain unimplemented.

The solutions are written in Python 3. To run the scripts, pass them to your Python interpreter:

```
$ cd 2020/day-1
$ python3 day-1.py input.txt
```
